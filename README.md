When I was coming up with the design for this ice cream shop, I wanted something space themed.
I had so many ideas in my head of something elegant and so many different features, but I decided to do something more simple without all the fancy stuff (for now at least.)

FEATURES-

Clickable menu button with a drop down list of different flavors and prices.
Color changes of the moon in the top left corner.
Mobile responsive.

TOOLS-

HTML5
CSS3 (Flexbox)
VS Code
GitHub

HOW TO RUN LUNAR LICKS-

Go to my public GitHub. @dsizemore98
Clone the Lunar Licks repo to your computer.
Open VS CODE. If you do not have it here's a link! https://code.visualstudio.com/
Select the file you put Lunar Licks into within VS CODE.
Make sure you have the live server extension.
Then travel to space, don't forget your helmet!

MY EXPERIENCE, OF MY FIRST HACKATHON-

The biggest challenge for me was making sure it was unique. I wanted something simple, but different.
I really wanted a lighter color scheme, so I used most of the "light" colors for the design. The goal was to mak Lunar Licks pop!
Another challenge was making sure Lunar Licks looked good on different sized devices. After some adjustments, the main frame of the building was in the center and not off the page completely... 

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS-

To combine different flavors.
Select different sized cones/bowls.
Add some outside features, street lamps ect!
Add more stars in the sky and around the moon.
Add some distant planets as well.
